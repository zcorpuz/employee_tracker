# employee_tracker
This application allows a user to create, read, update, and destroy a company's database of employees utilizing Inquirer, Node, and MySQL. 

## User Story
```
As a business owner
I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
So that I can organize and plan my business
```

## Installation
Package.json file includes all required dependencies. Type 'npm install' into Terminal to download

## Usage
I have provided a seed.sql file that will auto-populate your database of fake employees so that you can easily start using the application. The application will start without this if you would like to start from scratch. To ensure that all data lines up, ensure to view employee list to see id's.
